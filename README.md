# Network_First_Project
### Client_Server with Tornado
Question 1 is a client_server system using socket(easy :no_mouth:)

Question 2 is a "ticketing system" and has these features:
- signup
- login
- logout
- send ticket
- get tickets(user)
- close ticket(user)
- get tickets(master)
- response to a ticket(master)
- change status(master)

This project is a client_server project with the **Tornado** framework which uses **MySQL** for the database.
The server supports "get" and "post", but the client is only "post".
